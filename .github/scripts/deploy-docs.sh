# the run was meant to publish and fails naming what is missing.
#
#   dev        deploys the `dev` version and publishes the viewer into `viewer/dev/`.
#   release    deploys X.Y. When X.Y is the highest version on gh-pages, counting X.Y itself
#              (is-latest-minor.sh over versions.json), it also moves the `latest` alias and the
#              default onto X.Y, and publishes the viewer into `viewer/` and llms.txt at the root;
#              otherwise it deploys only its own folder and leaves `latest`, the viewer and
#              llms.txt alone.
#
# mike and publish-viewer.sh (PUSH=local) only commit onto the local gh-pages branch; this
# script pushes it. By default every read of gh-pages is of the commit a fresh
# `git fetch origin gh-pages` returned, and every write runs through retry-gh-pages.sh, which
# resets the local gh-pages to that commit, then the write and its push run; gh-pages must
# already exist on origin, or the first fetch fails the run. With --no-push nothing is fetched
# or pushed, and the reads and the final checks are of the local branch, which may not exist yet.
#
# The push token: a push run reads it from PAGES_PUSH_TOKEN (the workflow's GITHUB_TOKEN), keeps
# it in an unexported shell variable and removes PAGES_PUSH_TOKEN before anything else runs, so
# mike, mkdocs and every other command run without it. Only `git push` gets it, as an
# Authorization header in that one command's environment (GIT_CONFIG_COUNT and friends): never
# in argv, .git/config or a file. Tracing is switched off first, so `bash -x` cannot print it.
#
# Runs from the repository root. Needs mike (and mkdocs) on the PATH, jq, base64, a git
# identity, the viewer's module in viewer/pkg (make wasm) and GITHUB_SHA, which names the
# viewer's commit.
