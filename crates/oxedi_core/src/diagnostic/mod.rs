//! Findings about a file's data, each one readable on its own.

//! A diagnostic names the rule that failed, where it failed (segment index,
//! element and component position, and the open loops with the ordinal of
//! each instance) and the offending value as it appears in the file. It holds
//! owned values only, so it can be printed, stored or sent elsewhere without
//! the spec or the document that produced it.
//!
//! The folder holds: this file (the loop and diagnostic types, the SNIP
//! levels and the byte quoting helper), `rule.rs` (the rules, their levels
//! and variant names), `display.rs` (the message text of each rule) and
//! `tests.rs`.
