//! Masking of the columns the spec flags as patient data, in the rows the
//! projector appends and in the datums of the diagnostics it hands out.
//!
//! A row is masked just before it is appended, so every column has its final
//! value whatever order the segments came in. Text of a `name` or `id` column
//! becomes its keyed token; an empty text stays empty and a null stays null.
//! A `date` column follows the mask's date mode: the year keeps January 1 of
//! the same year, a shift adds the days the row's seed gives, and keep leaves
//! it. The seed is the unmasked value of the table's seed column, or, for a
//! table that declares none, of the nearest table above it that declares one
//! (its row is still open, so still unmasked). A row with no seed value, or
//! whose shift would leave the date range, gets the year instead.
//!
//! A diagnostic's datum is masked when the place it names (segment id,
//! element, component) is one a flagged column can read: a `name` or `id`
//! datum becomes its token, a `date` datum that is a valid date becomes the
//! masked date written `CCYYMMDD` (the year, as no row is at hand to seed a
//! shift), and one that is not becomes its token. An element read whole
//! covers its components, and a finding about a whole element covers the
//! components read from it. Places are matched by segment id alone, so the
//! same element of a segment in another loop, or with another qualifier, is
//! masked too. The segment id is the one the rule names, or the segment being
//! fed when the diagnostic is about it; a balancing finding names an earlier
//! segment, but its datum is an `R` amount, which no flagged column reads.
//! Findings another validator raised about a document are matched the same
//! way, by the segment their index names in it. The message of such a finding
//! may quote values of that segment whatever element it names, or none, so
//! the original datum, when the datum was masked, and each value the segment
//! holds at a flagged place are replaced by their masked forms where the
//! message quotes them; the module notes of `quote.rs` say where.
