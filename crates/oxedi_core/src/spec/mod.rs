//! Loop specifications: the data that tells the engine how a file is structured.
//!
//! A spec is plain JSON: a map of loops, each naming its parent, the segment
//! (and optional element conditions) that opens it, the occurrences of
//! segments it may hold (named, with position, usage, maximum repeat,
//! qualifier and own code lists) and an optional segment that closes it. An
//! optional `segments` section names and types the elements of each segment
//! id, wherever the segment appears. Loading compiles that into index-based definitions so the engine
//! never compares strings, and keeps the JSON value so patches can be applied
//! on top. Patches follow RFC 7386: objects merge key by key, while arrays and
//! scalars replace wholesale; see [`Spec::merge_patch`] for what that means
//! for a loop's occurrences.
//!
//! The module is split by responsibility: `loops`, `occurrences`, `segments`
//! and `tables` hold the definitions, `occurrence_error` why an occurrence
//! is rejected; `raw` the deserialization shapes;
//! `shape` the JSON shape checks; `build` and `compile` the construction of a [`Spec`];
//! `error` the load error; `render` the text used in messages; `patch` the
//! merge patch; `version` the version declaration and the choice of a spec
//! by it.
