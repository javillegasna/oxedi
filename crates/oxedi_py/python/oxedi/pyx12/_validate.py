def validate(

    """Validates an 835 file with pyx12 and returns what it finds.

    ``source`` is the file's bytes, a path, or a file object open in binary
    mode. pyx12 picks its map from the file's own version declaration.
    pyx12's own defaults apply: extended character set (``charset="E"``),
    no external code lists excluded (``exclude_external_codes=None``),
    and user/system configuration files (``~/.pyx12.conf.xml``,
    ``<prefix>/etc/pyx12.conf.xml``) are not read, so findings do not
    depend on the machine.

    Every error pyx12's engine records is returned: interchange, group and
    transaction errors, segment errors and element errors, including those
    of the envelope segments. They are read from the error tree pyx12
    builds; pyx12's logging is not used. The ``pyx12`` logger gets a
    ``logging.NullHandler`` the first time, when it has none, so pyx12's
    records are not printed by default and still reach the handlers the
    caller configures; levels, propagation and ``logging.disable`` stay as
    the caller set them.

    Each finding is an ``oxedi.Diagnostic``, the type ``parse``
    returns, so both lists mix, sort by ``level`` and filter by ``origin``.
    A pyx12 finding has ``kind == "External"``, ``origin == "pyx12"`` and
    ``code`` set to pyx12's own error code; ``rule`` is pyx12's message.
    ``level`` follows where pyx12 reports it: interchange, group and
    transaction findings are level 1, segment and element findings level 2.
    ``segment`` is the index of the segment at fault in the file's document
    (``None`` when pyx12 names none), and ``document[d.segment].span`` gives
    its byte range. An interchange, group or transaction finding about a
    trailer (a count or a control number that does not match) lands on the
    trailer segment at the element holding that value; one about a
    duplicate or missing control structure lands on the header, at its
    control number when that is the offending value. ``datum`` is the value
    pyx12 reports, or else the bytes of the element in the file, or the
    segment id for a finding with no element. Findings come in
    segment order. ``path`` names the loops open at that segment, as in the
    diagnostics ``parse`` gives about the same segment.

    A file pyx12 cannot read, or an exception inside pyx12, gives one
    level 1 finding with no ``code`` whose ``rule`` starts with ``could
    not finish validating``, instead of raising: a file pyx12 rejects
    points at the segment holding the ISA with its bytes as the datum; a
    failure while reading names the segment pyx12 was processing, and one
    after the last segment names the last segment it completed. A file
    with no ISA to read the delimiters from raises ``oxedi.ParseError``,
    as ``oxedi.parse`` does. Nothing is written to disk and no
    acknowledgement is generated.

    With ``mask``, an ``oxedi.Mask``, the datum of a finding at a place a
    column flags as patient data reads is masked as ``parse`` masks its own
    diagnostics with that mask. In the finding's message, the original
    datum and each value its segment holds at such a place are replaced by
    their masked forms, whether or not the finding names an element. A
    value of 4 characters or more is replaced wherever it occurs. A shorter
    one is replaced only where it stands apart: the character on each side
    is the edge of the message, a character that is not an ASCII letter or
    digit (an accented letter or ``-`` counts), or part of another replaced
    value. Short values that overlap or touch are replaced as one group when
    the group stands apart. A short value glued to letters or digits that
    are not flagged values stays as written (with ``XAB`` and ``ABYZ``
    flagged, ``QXABYZ`` keeps ``QX``), and two short values that together
    spell a word of the message replace that word. Every other attribute,
    and the findings' number and order, stay as without it. The flagged
    places are those of the spec the parse uses: ``spec``, an
    ``oxedi.Spec``, or the built-in spec of the file's version when it is
    ``None``, so a patched spec that flags more columns masks them here as
    ``parse(source, spec=spec, mask=mask)`` does. The same spec locates the
    findings' loop paths, as in ``parse(source, spec=spec)``. A failure
    finding for an exception inside pyx12, whose text no flagged place
    points at, keeps the exception's type and drops its text: ``could not
    finish validating: ValueError, whose message is not shown with a mask;
    ...``, or ``its error tree could not be read (ValueError, whose message
    is not shown with a mask)``. The rest of such a finding is text oxedi
    wrote, so the mask does not rewrite it; its datum is masked as any other.
    The finding for a file pyx12 rejects quotes pyx12's X12Error, which can
    hold the whole ISA line, and its message is masked as pyx12's messages are;
    its datum is ``ISA`` instead of the ISA line, which names no element.
    pyx12 still reads the original file: the
    mask hides what ``validate`` returns, not what pyx12 is given. ``mask``
    of any other type than ``oxedi.Mask`` or ``None`` raises ``TypeError``,
    and so does ``spec`` of any other type than ``oxedi.Spec`` or ``None``.
