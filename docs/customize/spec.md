# Customizing the spec

A JSON spec defines the structure of the 835 and the columns of each table. You can choose a
version, or adapt the spec to a payer's variations with a patch, without touching the code.
`parse`, `parse_file` and `stream` all accept `spec=`.

## Choose a version

By default oxedi reads the version a file declares (`ISA12` and `GS08`) and uses the matching
built-in spec:

- 5010 (`005010X221A1`), the default.
- 4010 (`004010X091A1`), for 4010 files.

Pass `spec=` to override it, or pick one yourself:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import oxedi

data = Path("remittance-4010.835").read_bytes()
spec = oxedi.Spec.builtin(version=oxedi.Version.V4010)
result = oxedi.parse(data, spec=spec)
print(result.spec, result.count_claims())
```

```text
Spec(name='835', loops=8, tables=5) 4
```

`result.spec` is the spec that projected the tables: the one you gave, or the built-in one
selected from the file's version.

## Add a column with a patch

A patch in JSON Merge Patch format (RFC 7386) adapts the spec. This one adds a column to
`claims`, read from `REF02` of the claim's `REF*CE`:

```python
spec = oxedi.Spec.builtin().patch({
    "tables": {"claims": {"columns": {
        "contract_class": {"segment": "REF", "where": {"1": "CE"}, "element": 2}
    }}}
})
result = oxedi.parse(Path("remittance.835").read_bytes(), spec=spec)
print("contract_class" in result.tables["claims"].columns)
```

```text
True
```

- Objects merge key by key.
- Arrays are replaced whole.
- `patch` accepts a dict or JSON text, and raises `oxedi.SpecError` when the result is not a
  valid spec.

## Choose where a column reads

A column reads one element of one segment. You pick the segment in one of two ways:

- `segment`, with optional `where` conditions on its elements:
  `{"segment": "REF", "where": {"1": "CE"}, "element": 2}`.
- A named occurrence of the loop: `{"occurrence": "patient_name", "element": 3}`.

Add `loop` to read a loop inside the table's anchor or above it. In the services table, this
column gives each service its claim's id:

```python
import polars as pl

spec = oxedi.Spec.builtin().patch({
    "tables": {"services": {"columns": {
        "claim_id": {"loop": "2100", "occurrence": "claim_payment_information", "element": 1}
    }}}
})
services = oxedi.parse_file("remittance.835", spec=spec).tables["services"].to_polars()
print(services.select("row", pl.col("claim_id", "procedure_code").cast(pl.String)))
```

```text
┌─────┬──────────┬────────────────┐
│ row ┆ claim_id ┆ procedure_code │
│ --- ┆ ---      ┆ ---            │
│ i64 ┆ str      ┆ str            │
╞═════╪══════════╪════════════════╡
│ 0   ┆ CLM1001  ┆ 99213          │
│ 1   ┆ CLM1001  ┆ 85025          │
│ 2   ┆ CLM1002  ┆ 97110          │
│ 3   ┆ CLM2001  ┆ 99212          │
└─────┴──────────┴────────────────┘
```

??? note "Details: when the segment repeats"
    When an occurrence repeats, `pick` chooses `"first"` (the default), `"last"` or the n-th
    match, counting from 1. It chooses among the segments read while the row's loop instance
    is open. A loop above the anchor offers the segments its enclosing instance read before the
    row's instance opened.

## Flag patient data

Which columns [hide patient data](../python/without-patient-data.md) when you pass a mask is
part of the spec. A column carries a `phi` key with one of three words:

- `"name"` and `"id"` become a keyed token. They need a text column (`AN` or `ID` element, or
  one the spec does not type).
- `"date"` shifts or reduces a date. It needs a date (`DT`) column.

A table can also carry `phi_seed`, the name of one `id` column. With `dates="shift"` its value
decides how many days the row and the rows under it move; the built-in `claims` table uses
`patient_id`.

```python
spec = oxedi.Spec.builtin().patch({
    "tables": {"claims": {"columns": {
        "contract_class": {"segment": "REF", "where": {"1": "CE"}, "element": 2, "phi": "id"}
    }}}
})
mask = oxedi.Mask("a-secret-of-at-least-16-bytes")
result = oxedi.parse(Path("remittance.835").read_bytes(), spec=spec, mask=mask)
print("contract_class" in spec.schema()["claims"].names)
```

```text
True
```

A patch that flags a numeric column, uses another word, flags a column that is not a date with
`"date"`, names a `phi_seed` column the table lacks, or names one that is not flagged `"id"`
raises `oxedi.SpecError` with the table, the column and the reason. A patch that removes or
unflags `claims.patient_id` must also set `"phi_seed": null` on `claims` (or name another `id`
column).

## Add or change a segment

A loop's segments are named occurrences. A patch adds one by its name, or changes it, or
removes it with `null`:

```json
{"loops": {"1000A": {"occurrences": {"xx": {"segment": "XX", "pos": 11400}}}}}
```

`pos` orders the occurrences of a loop. The occurrence a loop opens on comes first: every other
occurrence of the loop has a higher `pos`.

??? note "Details: how positions are numbered"
    The transaction and every loop below it share one position space. The built-in spec
    numbers a segment of the transaction's n-th table at n × 10000 plus its
    implementation-guide position: 1000A's N1 is 10800, 2100's CLP 20100. A child loop's
    occurrences sit at their own positions inside that space.

## Write with a custom spec

A patched spec also writes: pass it to `oxedi.write(frames, envelope, spec=spec)`. See
[Writing](../python/writing.md).

## Spec keys reference

Every key a spec can hold, with what it means and the Rust code that reads it. The JSON is
deserialized into the `Raw*` structs of `crates/oxedi_core/src/spec/raw.rs`, checked by
`spec/shape.rs`, then compiled into the definitions of `oxedi_core::spec`. For the internal names, see the [glossary](https://github.com/javillegasna/oxedi/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md#glossary). An unknown key is an
error that names its path, and so is a missing required key. Positions of elements and
components are 1-based. The code names differ from the JSON in three places: a table's
`loops` are its *anchors*, `end` is a loop's *closer*, and `ref` is the *reference* name.

### Root

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `name` | yes | The spec's name, shown in `Spec(name=...)`. | `Spec::name`, `build.rs` |
| `loops` | yes | The loop structure, by loop name; at least one loop. | `LoopDef`, `build.rs` |
| `segments` | no | Names and types the elements of each segment id. | `SegmentDef`, `segments.rs` |
| `tables` | no | The tables of the projection, by table name. | `TableDef`, `compile.rs` |
| `balancing` | no | Amounts that must add up inside a loop, by rule name. | `BalanceRule`, `balance.rs` |
| `version` | no | Which versions of the format the spec covers, used to choose a built-in spec. | `DeclaredVersion`, `version.rs` |

### `version`

| Key | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|---------|------|
| `segment` | Id of the segment that carries the version, for example `GS`. | `DeclaredVersion::segment` |
| `element` | Position of the element that holds it, for example `8`. | `DeclaredVersion::element` |
| `values` | The values of that element the spec covers. | `DeclaredVersion::values` |

All three are required. The first segment with that id decides.

### `loops.<name>`

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `parent` | no | Name of the enclosing loop; none for a top-level loop. | `LoopDef::parent` |
| `trigger` | yes | The segment that opens the loop (see below). | `Trigger`, `loops.rs` |
| `occurrences` | no | The named places segments take in the loop (see below). | `OccurrenceDef`, `occurrences.rs` |
| `usage` | no | `required` or `situational` (the default): whether every instance of the parent holds an instance of this loop. | `Usage`, read by `check/occurrences.rs` |
| `max` | no | Most instances under one parent instance; at least 1. | `LoopDef::max`, `check/occurrences.rs` |
| `end` | no | The segment that closes the loop; the loop captures it. It cannot be the trigger's segment. | `LoopDef::end`, `engine/mod.rs` |
| `control` | no | What the `end` segment must agree on with the trigger; needs `end`. | `Control`, `loops.rs`; checked by `check/mod.rs` |

`trigger`:

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `segment` | yes | Segment id. |
| `where` | no | Conditions on the segment's elements: `{"<position>": "<value>"}`. All must hold. |

`control`, all four keys required (this is how `ST`/`SE`, `GS`/`GE` and `ISA`/`IEA` are checked):

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `opener_element` | Position of the control number in the trigger, for example 2 for `ST02`. |
| `closer_element` | Position of the same number in the `end` segment, for example 2 for `SE02`. |
| `count_element` | Position of the count in the `end` segment, for example 1 for `SE01`. |
| `count` | What the count counts: `segments` (trigger to end, both included) or `children` (child loop instances). |

### `loops.<name>.occurrences.<name>`

An occurrence is a named place for a segment inside a loop. The occurrence the loop's trigger
opens on has the lowest `pos` of its loop.

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `segment` | yes | Segment id. | `OccurrenceDef::segment` |
| `pos` | yes | Order inside the loop; see "how positions are numbered" above. | `OccurrenceDef::pos` |
| `usage` | no | `required` or `situational` (the default). | `OccurrenceDef::usage` |
| `max` | no | Most times it may repeat in one instance. | `OccurrenceDef::max` |
| `qualifier` | no | Tells this occurrence apart from others of the same segment in the loop. | `Qualifier` |
| `codes` | no | Code lists of its own, by `"<element>"` or `"<element>-<component>"`; for a segment at this occurrence the list replaces the element's own; it need not be a subset, and it works on an element that has none. | `OccurrenceDef::codes` |

`qualifier`: `element` (required), `component` (optional) and `codes` (required, the values
that identify the occurrence). Two occurrences of one segment in a loop need qualifiers on the
same place with no code in common. Occurrences are checked by `check/occurrences.rs`; columns and
balancing rules refer to them by name.

### `segments.<id>.elements.<position>`

The only key of a segment is `elements`. An element or a component takes these keys:

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `name` | yes | Name used downstream; unique among its siblings. | `ElementDef::name` |
| `type` | yes | `AN`, `ID`, `N0` to `N9`, `R`, `DT` or `TM`. | `ElementType`, `segments.rs` |
| `required` | no | The element must be present and not empty. Default false. | `ElementDef::required` |
| `min`, `max` | no | Length bounds, counted as X12 counts them (digits only for `N` and `R`). | `ElementDef` |
| `scale` | no | Decimal places of an `R` element, 2 by default, at most 18. Only `R` accepts it. | `ElementType::R` |
| `codes` | no | The values the element may hold: non-empty, no empty or repeated code, each within `min` and `max`. Refused on `N0` to `N9` and `R`, and on an element with `composite`. | `ElementDef::codes` |
| `composite` | no | Components by position, with these same keys. Only on `AN`, and not nested. | `ElementDef::composite` |

The element checks of `project` and the writer's formatting read these.

### `tables.<name>`

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `loops` | yes | The anchors: one row per instance of each listed loop. In a table without `segment`, no anchor may sit inside another, and a loop anchors only one such table. | `TableDef::loops` |
| `ref` | no | The name of the column that tables below this one use to refer to a row of it. Defaults to the table's name; unique among tables. | `TableDef::reference` |
| `segment` | no | One row per occurrence of this segment in an anchor, instead of per loop instance. | `TableDef::segment` |
| `repeat` | no | One row per element group of `segment`; needs `segment`. | `Repeat` |
| `columns` | no | The declared columns, by name. | `ColumnSource`, `columns.rs` |
| `phi_seed` | no | Name of one column flagged `"id"`; its value decides how far the row's dates shift. | `TableDef::phi_seed`, `phi.rs` |

`repeat`, both required: `from` (position of the first group's first element) and `step`
(elements per group). Both are at least 1.

The names `row` and `segment` are reserved for columns and for `ref`. The rows of a table are
built by `oxedi_core::project`.

### `tables.<name>.columns.<name>`

A column has exactly one source: `element`, `group_element` or `segment_index`.

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `element` | Position of the element to read. |
| `component` | Position of the component of a composite element (with `element` or `group_element`). |
| `group_element` | Offset inside the group of a `repeat` table, from 0 to `step - 1`. Needs `repeat`. |
| `segment_index` | `true` reads the index of the segment instead of a value. Cannot take `component`. |
| `segment` | Id of the segment to read. A column of a table without `segment` names `segment` or `occurrence`. |
| `where` | Conditions on its elements: `{"<position>": "<value>"}`; with `segment`. |
| `occurrence` | Name of an occurrence of the reading loop, instead of `segment`; it excludes `segment` and `where`. |
| `loop` | The loop to read from, inside the anchor or above it; the anchor loop when absent. |
| `pick` | Which match to take: `"first"` (the default), `"last"` or a position counted from 1. Needs `occurrence`, on an occurrence that can repeat (not `max: 1`); a position cannot pass its `max`. |
| `phi` | `"name"`, `"id"` or `"date"`: the column holds patient data, hidden by a mask. `name` and `id` need a text column, `date` a date column; refused on an envelope control or count element. |

In a table with `segment`, the column reads that segment only, so `segment`, `where`,
`occurrence`, `loop` and `pick` are rejected. See [Choose where a column
reads](#choose-where-a-column-reads) and [Flag patient data](#flag-patient-data).

### `balancing.<name>`

A rule holds when, in every instance of the `per` loop, both sides add up to the same amount
to the last decimal place. A failure is reported as a diagnostic by `check/balance.rs`.

| Key | Required | Meaning | Rust |
|-----|----------|---------|------|
| `per` | yes | The loop whose every instance is checked. | `BalanceRule::per` |
| `target` | yes | The amounts the rule expects: a list of values. | `BalanceTerm` |
| `sum` | yes | The amounts that must add up to the target: a list of values. | `BalanceTerm` |

A value of `target` or `sum` takes `occurrence` (required, the name of an occurrence),
`elements` (required, positions to read), `loop` (optional, a loop below `per`; `per` itself
when absent), `component` (optional) and `sign` (`"+"`, the default, or `"-"`). Every
appearance of the occurrence adds to its side.
