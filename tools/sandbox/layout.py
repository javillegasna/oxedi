"""What the sandbox protects in a checkout: the paths bound read-only over it and the ones masked.

Read-only, in both phases: what the host executes or trusts after a run (the fixed list below),
plus every tracked file git names like a build or tool configuration, every tracked `.cargo`
directory and every submodule (the host's make targets include their makefiles), wherever they
are, among them every tracked file a host tool loads by its name alone (pytest a `conftest.py`,
Python a `sitecustomize.py`, direnv an `.envrc`). A name the host loads from the root
(`GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, `conftest.py`) is read-only when present; when absent, the run phase
binds a read-only stand-in over it, so the run cannot create it. Hidden, in both phases: the
maintainers' notes and every path git ignores, except the sandbox's own outputs, so a run can
neither read nor change them. An ignored directory is masked by an empty read-only tmpfs; an
ignored file has an empty read-only file bound over it. A directory git ignores as a whole (it
holds no tracked file) is masked whole, caches inside it included.
