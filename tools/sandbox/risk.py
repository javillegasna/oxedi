"""What a change touches, judged without running any of it: the paths whose kind lets a change run
code or steer a tool, and whether the change, with the packages deps.py finds, needs a
confirmation.

Every text is read through `isolated_git` and parsed as data; nothing of the clone is imported or
executed. The diff reads attributes from no tree, so the change's own `.gitattributes` cannot hide
a binary file.
