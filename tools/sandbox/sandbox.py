#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Runs a command of this checkout in a throwaway, hardened container of the sandbox image.

The container runs as the user, with a read-only root, no capabilities, no new privileges, the
default seccomp profile and limits on processes, memory and CPUs. It sees the checkout at /work,
with the files the host executes later (Makefile, make/, tools/, ...) bound read-only on top, the
maintainers' notes and every path git ignores hidden, and its own storage under
${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/oxedi-sandbox: target/ and .venv/ per checkout, the cargo registry
shared. No host variable and no part of the
host home other than that storage reaches it. Two phases, each in its own containers:
- fetch: with network, the checkout read-only, no project code run: `cargo fetch --locked` and
  wheels only for the venv, written to the shared caches; it never falls back to them offline;
- run: the command, with no network and the cargo registry read-only.
After the run, an audit lists every file it changed, every new path it left and every path it
cannot read, and removes the Python caches and the built extension it may have left in the
checkout. A dirty audit is recorded in the checkout's storage, and the next start refuses while a
path it named is still as the run left it. One run of a checkout at a time: a second one is refused
while the first holds the run lock of the checkout's storage (lock.py), and so is a clean of it.

Run it isolated (`python3 -I`), as make does, so no file in the checkout or variable of the shell
can shadow a module it imports.

usage: sandbox.py --image TAG --kind {base,viewer} --checkout DIR
       sandbox.py --clean {checkout,all} --checkout DIR
`--kind viewer` names a viewer image (make sandbox-image-viewer): its runs also get the docs venv
at .venv-docs, made by the fetch from the hashed docs/requirements.txt, and, when the checkout
tracks ui/bun.lock, ui/dist and ui/node_modules, which the fetch installs with Bun. The run is
refused when the checkout pins another Playwright, wasm-bindgen or binaryen than the image was built with.
The command comes from SANDBOX_CMD. SANDBOX_CPUS (default: the daemon's CPUs minus one),
SANDBOX_MEMORY (GB; default 60 % of the daemon's memory) and SANDBOX_TIMEOUT (seconds; default
3600) set the limits.
Exit status: the command's; 3 when the audit found a change, a new path or a path it cannot read
(whatever the command's status); 124 when it ran past the timeout; 130 on Ctrl-C (SIGINT), 143
on SIGTERM and 129 on SIGHUP (a closed terminal); 2 when the sandbox refuses to start.
